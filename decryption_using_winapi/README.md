2. decryption_using_winapi.exe  ==> Final application that takes input file dapp_encrypted.exe and 
                                    generates the original decrypted file dapp_decrypted_or_dapp.exe on execution.
3. dapp_decrypted_or_dapp.exe   ==> Output decrypted file or the original file of the encrypted file.
4. src                          ==> This folder contains all source and input files of the final application.
